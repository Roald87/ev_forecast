# Market share forecast of battery electrical vehicles
I made a Python script of a model which can be used to predict the market share of a product. 

The model is from an article in the *Nederlands Tijdschrift voor Natuurkunde* (Dutch Journal of Physics) titled *Waarom wij wel zonnepanelen maar nog geen kernfusiestroom hebben* (Why we have solar panels but no nuclear fusion power) by Niek Lopes Cardozo, Guido Lange and Gert Jan Kramer (NTvN 83, October 2017, page 350-354). This article is again based on two previous articles by the authors. The one which is not behind a paywall, is called [‘The cradle of new energy technologies. Why we have solar cells but not yet nuclear fusion?’](http://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/colours.html#vanity-aHR0cDovL3d3dy5zaGVsbC5jb20vY29sb3Vycw), published on December 2015 in ‘The colours of energy. Essays on the future of energy and society’. I then used it to predict the market share of electric vehicles with time, for the entire world ([html](https://roald87.github.io/ev_forecast/Market_share_electric_vehicles.html), [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Roald87/ev_forecast/blob/master/Market_share_electric_vehicles.ipynb)) and Norway ([html](https://roald87.github.io/ev_forecast/Forecasting_Norways_EV_market.html), [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/Roald87/ev_forecast/blob/master/Forecasting_Norways_EV_market.ipynb)) specifically.
